3. **`README-ansible-lint.md`** - Quick start guide and basic usage instructions
4. **`INSTALLATION.md`** - Comprehensive installation and setup guide
5. **`test-ansible-lint.sh`** - Automated testing script for validation

### Example Structure
- **`ansible-lint-examples/`** - Complete sample ansible project demonstrating:
  - Sample playbooks with real-world patterns
  - Role structure with flexible naming conventions
  - Variable files showing different naming patterns
  - Inventory and configuration examples
  - Requirements file for Galaxy dependencies

### Key Features

#### Rule Categories Covered (50+ exclusions)
1. **Syntax & Formatting** - Line length, indentation, spacing flexibility
2. **Command & Module** - Shell/command usage when modules aren't suitable
3. **Variable & Templating** - Flexible naming conventions and Jinja2 patterns
4. **Task & Play Structure** - Naming requirements and structural flexibility
5. **Loop & Conditional** - Variable patterns and conditional logic
6. **Handler & Notification** - Notification patterns and dependencies
7. **Role & Collection** - Metadata requirements and structure flexibility
8. **Security** - Permission handling with documented exceptions
9. **Performance** - Package management and efficiency considerations
10. **Legacy Support** - Deprecated features during migrations
11. **Development** - Testing patterns and debug flexibility

#### Excluded Paths (25+ patterns)
- Cache and temporary directories
- CI/CD configuration files
- Virtual environments and build artifacts
- Third-party code and vendor directories
- Documentation and example files
- Testing fixtures and molecule configurations

## Technical Specifications

### Compatibility
- **ansible-lint**: 25.6.1 (latest)
- **ansible-core**: 2.19.0+ (supports 2.12+)
- **Python**: 3.8+

### Configuration Options
- **Profile**: Production-optimized
- **Verbosity**: Balanced output level
- **Offline Mode**: Supported for air-gapped environments
- **Custom Rules**: Directory support for additional rules

## Testing Results

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Configuration validation passed
- ✅ Sample structure linting completed
- ✅ Strict comparison demonstrated effectiveness
- ✅ Rule analysis shows comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Performance test passed (< 10 seconds)

### Performance Metrics
- **Linting Speed**: 3 seconds for example structure
- **Rule Coverage**: 69 excluded rules from comprehensive list
- **File Processing**: 9 YAML files processed successfully

## Usage Benefits

### For Development Teams
- **Faster Development**: Reduced time spent on overly strict formatting rules
